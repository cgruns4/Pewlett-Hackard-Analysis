# PEWLETT-HACKARD-ANALYSIS

## Project Overview
The purpose of this projecct is to determine the number of retiring employees per title at Pewlett Hackard.  Additionaly, we also 
need to identify which employess are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.  In order to start the project, I developed an developed an SQL flowchart to establish the relationships between the databases initially provided.

Subsequently, after building many more relational databases, I was able to get to the analysis at hand.

## Analysis of Retiring Employees by Title:
- Upon reviewing the new combined retiring by title table, it is evident that the largest amount of upcoming retirements are within the 
  Senior Engineering and Senior Staff Departments.
- There are 29,415 Senior Engineers and 28,255 Senior Staff coming up for retirement.
- It is of no surprise that the most Senior employees, would be closest to retirement, however with so many employees with an expertise in Engineering,
  it would be advised to begin mentoring the up and coming engineers to be more prepared to move upward to senior roles.

## STRATEGIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
- It is of the utmost importance to prepare for potential upcoming wave of retirees.  Currently the firm would find itself greatly unprepared for an
  employee exodus due to retirement.   
- My first recommendation would be to expand the number of candidates viable for entry into the membership program by changing the date criteria for acceptance.  
  This would help to more readily prepare those internally to replace outgoing retirees.
- Second, I would recommend the company start looking into hiring individuals in advance of the retirement wave from outside the firm.  Getting these new employees acclimated
  to the firm before Pewlett Hackard finds itself caught behind and severly short of human capital is imperative.
